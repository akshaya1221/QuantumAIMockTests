# Quantum AI IIT JEE Mock Tests (VALLURI™)

VALLURI™ is a next-generation, agentic AI-powered mock testing and personalized coaching platform designed specifically for IIT-JEE (Mains & Advanced) aspirants. The system combines robust pedagogy with a multi-agent system that autonomously plans study sessions, resolves student doubts, grades exams, tracks real-time progress, and forecasts Rank/All India Rank (AIR) bands.

This repository hosts a multi-tier codebase containing a fully functional **FastAPI backend**, an elegant **React 19 + TypeScript web application**, and the blueprint architecture for specialized AI agents, mobile/desktop applications, SDKs, and cloud deployment pipelines.

## 💻 Development & Integration Flow

### Local State Mocking (Frontend Prototype)
The React frontend application currently uses a `localStorage` mocking approach in files like [Login.tsx](file:///E:/eduos/frontend/web/src/pages/Login.tsx) and [MockTest.tsx](file:///E:/eduos/frontend/web/src/pages/MockTest.tsx). This allows UI design and client-side page routing to function standalone without requiring a running backend.

To transition the frontend to integrate directly with the live FastAPI backend:
1.  Replace local storage writes and reads inside actions (e.g. `loginStudent` in `Login.tsx`) with asynchronous `fetch` or `axios` queries targeting the backend port (e.g. `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login`).
2.  Pass the active JWT token inside HTTP headers (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`) for routes requiring authentication.

### Database Reset & Seeding
If you need to reset the database schema or seed data during development:
1.  Stop the backend process.
2.  Delete the database file:
    ```bash
    rm backend/quantum_ai_jee.db
    ```
3.  Restart the backend server. The backend's startup event listener will auto-generate the database tables and insert sample questions (`Physics/Kinematics`, `Chemistry/Chemical Bonding`, `Mathematics/Algebra`).
